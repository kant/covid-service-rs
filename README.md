# covid-service-rs

Aim to convert the JavaScript https://github.com/mukundbhudia/covid-service into this Rust project

## Development

* Within the repo directory run `cargo run`.

* To make a production build, within the repo directory run `cargo build --release`.

Once a production release has been built (see Development), within the repo directory run `cargo run` (with arguments just like in the Development section).

### Resources
* To [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) for the hard work providing and collating the data.
